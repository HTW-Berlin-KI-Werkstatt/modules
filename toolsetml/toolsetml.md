## Python - the programming language of choice for machine learning

Python has become the programming language of choice for machine learning due to several factors:

- **Ease of Learning and Use:** Pythonâ€™s syntax is clean and readable, making it accessible for beginners and professionals alike.
- **Extensive Libraries:** Libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, SciPy, scikit-learn, TensorFlow, and PyTorch provide powerful tools for all aspects of machine learning.
- **Community and Support:** A large community means plenty of tutorials, guides, and forums for support.
- **Integration:** Python integrates well with other languages and tools, making it versatile for various projects (compared to Julia or MATLAB for example).

## Our tools

1. A neat first introduction to python is provided here: [Python basics](/modules/howto-python/python.md)
2. Never ever use python without a virtual environment, for example anaconda: [Anaconda howto](/modules/howto-anaconda/anaconda.md)
3. We will use Jupyter notebooks, learn more about them here [Jupyter notebooks](/modules/howto-jupyter/jupyter.md)
4. Git is essential, learn howto use it!
5. I highly recommend Visual Studio Code as an IDE
